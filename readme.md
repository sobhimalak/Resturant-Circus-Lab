# Circus Restaurant

### Background
You have a customer opening a new restaurant in the middle of Stockholm city. He has a new concept in mind... He wants people to eat and watch a circus show every Friday or Saturday. The restaurant owner is going to get a famous circus person to the restaurant in every show, which means every Friday/Saturday.

### Requirements
The customer wants your help building a website for his new Circus restaurant.
<ul>

<li> 1.	The website should contain an order system for customers to order food when they are in the restaurant. Every table would have a tablet in each table in the restaurant. As a customer you should be able to see the menu, order `a`nd choose ingredients. (100p)</li>
<li>2.	The website should also contain a booking system for the circus show every Friday or Saturday (50p)</li>
<li>3.	The website should contain information about the restaurant like e.g. phone number, address, map and contact... (50p)</li>
<li>4.	The landing page/home page should contain an ad for the shows to come. A user should be able to click on the ads and go directly to the booking system. (50p)</li>
</ul>


### Tools used
A variety of tools have been used in this project and are listed below:
<ul>
<li>Balsamiq: to build the wireframe and make the primary design of the website. It was
chosen because it’s very popular, responsive, and can be used in the clouds. Therefore,
all developers were able to access it and share their ideas.</li>
<li>VisualStudio Code: to write the HTML / CSS and javascript of the website. The is the best
tool in the industry to write websites.</li>
<li>Illustrator: to design the logos and some icons in the app.</li>
<li>Github: to share the code among developers and keep multiple versions of this project
in case unexpected problems happen.</li>
<li>Jquery library: to write Javascript. Jquery is extremely responsive, simple and quick to
use and therefore it was chosen as a default library when writing the Javascript code.</li>
</ul>

## Website description
The website contains two major components: 1) a general website for information about the restaurant and to allow customers to book tables, and 2) an app used only in the restaurant to order food and drinks. The app is optimised for Ipad and Iphone
### General website and booking app
#### Colors
The main colors of the website consist of black and green. Black reflect the color of mystery
that is in large circuses. The green represents our focus on vegan and eco-friendly products and
events.
#### Event Banner
When loading the website, a event banner popup will appear at the top of the page. It will show
the user about the next show and allow them to book it immediately when they click on ‘book
now’. The banner disappears automatically after 10 sec.
#### Booking form
A booking form has been included in the main website. By clicking on ‘Book Now’ a popup
appears to allow the customers to make a reservation. After booking, the customer will receive
a confirmation email straight to the address they specified in the form.
#### Contact form
A contact us option has been added at the top menu bar. By clicking it, a popup appears
allowing the customers to send inquiries to the restaurant. Contact numbers and the address of
the restaurant has been added to the bottom of the page. After clicking on submit, the
customer will receive a confirmation email straight to the address they specified in the form
thanking them for their question.
#### Meet the Chef
A small introductory section about the chef has been added after the main image. This serves
to show the importance of food quality is Circus Vegan. It proves to the customers that the
quality of food is very high and it is taken seriously in a way that the restaurant hired a famous
chef to take care of the menu.
#### Events option
As the events are important and play a big role in the restaurants concept, they were showed in
in the main website. The customer can click on ‘Events’ in the menu bar which will take them to
the event section in the website. The events are shown as a dynamic horizontal list.
#### Menu
The menu is shown beneath the events. It can also be accessed from the top menu bar. The
menu is dynamic, meaning that the customer can filter menu items to choose between starters,
mains, desserts or simply all. No pictures of food is shown in the main website in order to make
it more attractive.
#### Photos
Selected photos from the circus and the food were included in the main website in order to
attract customers. They will show the high quality of the events, and the delicious food in the
restaurant. Therefore, more graphic images will serve to increase the number of clients.
#### About us
To give more information about the restaurant and to give more credibility for this brand, an
‘about us’ section has been added. It can be accessed from the menu bar and it will open a new
window.
#### Translation into Swedish/English
A translation tab has been added to the top of the page above the menu bar. It translates
immediately all text from Swedish to English and vice versa. This functionality helps to attract
more customers, such as tourists, who are not comfortable in the language.

### Restaurant app and choosing from menu
This page is intended for use only in the restaurant only. The customer is supposed to brose the
menu, order food, call waiters, become a member, order a take-away and look at the events
calendar. This page is accessed from the main website through a click on the ‘Order and pay in
the app’ button.
#### Landing page
The landing page is the first page the customer
sees when accessing this web app. It has a sleek
design that reflects the character of the
restaurant with an acrobat lady in the main
page. It also has a very simplistic design
because this is the welcoming page and needs
to be simple and attractive. We chose to only
have a simple welcome message that embodies
the values of the restaurant and focus on the
“Vegan concept”. To access the following
pages, the customer will click on “let the show
begin” button to start browsing the menu.
Design: The color-palette from the main
website was also adopted here in order to keep
within the same design flow as the website,
hence the black and the green colors.
#### Home page
The home page shows an ad for the next event. We want to stress on the fact that events are
taking place, and for this reason we include the following:
<ul>
<li>The upcoming event appears big beneath the menu.</li>
<li>An 'upcoming events’ box is located beneath to encourage the users to go and checkout
all the events that will be taking place.</li>
<li>An Events menu item is located in the menu to allow the customers to also click on it
after leaving the home page.</li>
</ul>

‘Call a waiter’ function is added to the home
page. The comfort of the customer has been
taken into account during the design.
Assuming that some customers might not be
very knowledgeable in technology, or using
iPads/smart phones, the call waiter function
was added in order to account for this. The
user, therefore, can call a waiter whenever
they have a technical issue or if they simply
wish to order through a waiter instead of a
phone.
‘Take-Away’ function is for customers who
wish to order food and take it away. Once
clicked, it will take the user to the menu and
show the opening times for take-away as a
popup on top of the menu. The user can close
this popup and continue ordering food.
‘Become a member’ function is to allow
customers to become members. This is crucial
for the growth of the restaurant and for
encouraging customers to come back and dine again. Therefore, this function was also added in
this app, in addition to the main website, to attract more members. It is very simple and easy,
and the customer can quickly add their email to subscribe. They will receive all instructions by
email later.

#### Food page
When clicking on the food item in the menu bar, the food menu will appear. The menu is
elegantly designed with beautiful pictures to attract customers. The following functionalities
appear in this page:
<ul>
<li>‘Allergies’ filter showcasing ‘gluten free, low sugar and low carbs options. When
activated, only gluten free, low sugar or low carbs menu options will be shown to the
customer. This offers great comfort for the user who wishes to only focus on the food
they wish to, or can only eat according to their diet.</li>
<li>‘Plus button’ to the right of the food menu item. When clicked, this menu item will be
added to the order list.</li>
<li>‘Minus button’ appears to the left of the food menu when at least one item of the same
product is added to the order list. It will allow the customer to reject this item in case
they have changed their mind.</li>
<li>‘Customize button’ located at the bottom-left corner of the food item. When clicked, a
popup will appear asking the customer to choose individual, or additional, ingredients to
this menu dish. This functionality encapsulates another value of the restaurant, which is
freedom to choose and dare to change. If the customer is satisfied, they will click on
submit customized order, and the order will be added to the order list. A ‘custom order’
tag will appear next to it to show that it is different from the main menu.</li>
<li>‘Order List’ will appear at the top of the page beneath the allergies tab in case at least
one food or drink product as added to the order. When clicked, it will show all the items
the customers chose and the total price of the order. A ‘+’ and ‘-’ signs are positioned
right and left of each item accordingly. They will allow the customer to dynamically
change the order quantities without going back to the main menu. This provides more
comfort to the user and could possibly increase sales. At the bottom of this page, there
is a send order button. When clicked the customer commits to this order and sends it to
the kitchen. The order cannot be changed after this step. The customer should also
provide the table number so that the waiters can bring in the food once it’s ready.</li>
</ul>

#### Drinks page
The drinks page has the same functionalities as the food page. The drinks page has no allergies
function. They are separated in order to give the customer more freedom if they wish to focus
only on food, or drinks.
#### Events page
This page lists all the events that are confirmed to take place in the restaurant. Events are listed
according to their date. When each event is clicked, a popup appears to show the date of the
event and a description of what will happen.
